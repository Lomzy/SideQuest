        Step 1: Meta Website - Create Organisation
      </h3>
      <div class="description-section">
        <ng-container i18n>
          To allow installing apps & games to your headset we need to enable developer mode. To do this,
          you have to be a registered "developer" on the Meta website, it's free, quick and easy. Open
        </ng-container>
        <a class="diagnosticator" (click)="open('https://dashboard.oculus.com')">dashboard.oculus.com</a>
        <ng-container i18n>
          and create an 'organization'.
          You'll need to accept the developer agreement and to verify your account using either a credit card
          or a phone number. Most accounts will already be verified. Next you'll need to create an organisation like above.

      <video class="setup-image tall" #enableDevMode autoplay="true" loop="true" controls="false" src="https://sidequestvr.com/assets/videos/enable_dev_mode.mp4" (error)="videoError(enableDevMode, $event, 'assets/setup/enable_dev_mode.mp4')" (click)="open('https://sidequestvr.com/assets/images/get-sidequest/verify.png')"></video>
      <h3 i18n>
        Step 2: Enable Developer Mode and Reboot
      </h3>
      <div class="description-section" i18n>
        Now that youâ€™re a "developer", open the Oculus app on your smartphone or tablet. In the
        Settings tab, tap on the headset and tap 'More settings'. In the list, you should now see
        Developer Mode. Once you have enabled developer mode it is a good idea to reboot your headset
        to be able to see it on the device.

      <h3 i18n>
        Step 3: Connect USB Cable and Allow USB Debugging
      </h3>
      <div class="description-section" i18n>
        Now its time to connect the USB cable. Once you are connected you will have to allow USB
        debugging access on your headset. If you put your headset on at this point you will see
        something like the below. You should also select 'Always allow from this computer' to prevent
        this message from coming up every time you connect.
